# papers-per-week
A repository containing all of the papers that I'd reading under my friend's ![Vivek Rai](https://github.com/vivekiitkgp) initiative of 2 papers a week.  However, this is an optimistic estimate, and actual numbers may be high or low depending on the depth of the paper and other academic engagements.
